Some important moments in web development:

- clean code 
- best practices
- conventions, coding style
- debugging

  -----
  TO DO: 
  -----
  - build some small projects by implementing the stuff from 
    Fundamentals introduction

- BDD (Behaviour Drive Development)
  Write tests, Then write implementations.
  Then write another tests, and write another implementations.
  Iterate. 

- Transpiler: translates a modern code to older code, in order to 
  be understood by outdated engines.
- Polyfill: a script that updates/add new function, filling the gap 
  or missin implementations. 

  -----
  TO DO: 
  -----
  - study some not yet implemented language features, and try to 
    implement them by using transpilers and polyfills. 
  - setup a code build system based on webpack with babel-loader 
    plugin.

OOP
---

When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That’s architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or “Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” by G. Booch, and more.
