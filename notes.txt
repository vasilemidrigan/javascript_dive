Some important moments in web development:

- clean code 
- best practices
- conventions, coding style
- debugging

  -----
  TO DO: 
  -----
  - build some small projects by implementing the stuff from 
    Fundamentals introduction

- BDD (Behaviour Drive Development)
  Write tests, Then write implementations.
  Then write another tests, and write another implementations.
  Iterate. 

- Transpiler: translates a modern code to older code, in order to 
  be understood by outdated engines.
- Polyfill: a script that updates/add new function, filling the gap 
  or missin implementations. 

  -----
  TO DO: 
  -----
  - study some not yet implemented language features, and try to 
    implement them by using transpilers and polyfills. 
  - setup a code build system based on webpack with babel-loader 
    plugin.
