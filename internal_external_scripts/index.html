        The scripts are read from up to down order.

        --------------- 
        Internal script 
        --------------- 
        An internal script should be between body tags, 
        if we will put it everywhere else, we will see 
        that it appears in the head or in the body, 
        depending on which part of the document it
        placed.

        Usually internal scripts are used when we have
        simple files. 
    
    -->
    <script>
      console.log("This script is read second");
    </script>

    <!--
        ---------------
        External script
        ---------------
    
        First script below has an absolute path, the second
        one has a relative path.
        
        The benefit of using external scripts, is that the 
        browser will download it and save it into its cache, 
        then other pages that references to this script, will
        take it from the cache, instead of downloading it
        again, that makes the hole process so much faster. 

        If we have a script which has a src, and we also
        have some code between script tags, this code will be
        ignored, as the script is looking for the referenced 
        file in the src mentioned in the src attribute. 

    -->

    <script src="/hello_world/script.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>

    <script src="script.js">
      console.log("This code will note execute!")
    </script>

    <p>some text</p>
  </body>
</html>
