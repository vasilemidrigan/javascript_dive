 JavaScript
------------

 The intention of creating js was to make webpages alive.

 The programs in JavaScript are called scripts.

 JavaScript can run in browser, on server and on any other device
 that has tha JavaScript engine.

 Different browsers have different JavaScript engines, V9 in Chrome, 
 SpiderMonkey in Mozilla, Chakra for IE, etc. 

 -----------------------------
 How do Engine work basically? 
 -----------------------------
 1. The engine reads the script
 2. Converts the script into machine code
 3. Machine code runs

 The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. 

 ---------------------------------
 In browser JavaScript is able to: 
 ---------------------------------
 1. Manipulate the content of the webpage
 2. React to user actions
 3. Send requests over the network to remote servers
 4. Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitors.
 5. Remember the data on the client side. 
 6. And many other things. 

 ------------------------------------
 In browser JavaScript isn't able to: 
 ------------------------------------
 In browser JavaScript abilities are limited in order to protect the user's 
 safety.
 - no access to the OS files and functions, with a few little exceptions and
   permitions.
 - one page doesn't have the access to another one (Same Origin Policy). To 
   break the rule, both pages must agree for data exchange. 
 - JS can communicate to the server where the current page comes from, but 
   it cannot communicate with another sites or domains, it requires explicit
   agreements. 

   Such limitations are specific for browser envinronments but not on a server 
   for example. 

 -----------------------------
 What makes JavaScript unique?
 -----------------------------
 - Full integration with HTML/CSS
 - Simple things are done simply
 - Suported by all major browsers and enabled by default
