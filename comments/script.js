  In a good code, the amount of comments should be minimal, the code 
  should be easy to understand without comments. 

  If there is a lot of comments, then maybe we need to rewrite the code?

  The code should be self-descriptive.

  Good comments usually are those that give a bird eye view of the code, 
  the control flow in various situations, etc. 

  There is a tool called JSDoc for documenting functions: usage, parameters, 
  returned value, such comments allows us to understand the function 
  without looking into it. 

  Sometimes you fix an older solution, because you think you have now a 
  better one, but then you realize that the older was there for a reason, 
  and now you reverse the solution to the older one. The time was wasted. 
  So writing comments that explain the SOLUTION are very important, in 
  order to understand WHY was specifically this solution implemented and
  not another one that seems more reasonable at the moment. 

  So we comment: overall architecture, high-level view, function usage, 
  important solutions (especially when not obvious)

  Avoid code that tell how code works, and what it does.
